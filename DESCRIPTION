Description: Convert Decision Tree objects into tidy data frames, by using the
    framework laid out by the package broom, this means that decision tree 
    output can be easily reshaped, porocessed, and combined with tools like 
    'dplyr', 'tidyr' and 'ggplot2'. Like the package broom, broomstick
    provides three S3 generics: tidy, to summarise decision tree specific 
    features - tidy returns the variable importance table; augment adds columns 
    to the original data such as predictions and residuals; and glance, which
    provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics.
